# Interpreter

**Execute source code immediately (No compile needed)**  

Interpreter has more than one feature
1. Execute **Source Code** by self
2. Optimization **Source Code**, Execute it **immediately**
3. Call **Precompiled Code** from compiler of interpreter system

<br>

> Interpreter is a program that execute source code **line by line**  
> Ex) Python, Lisp, Ruby etc... (It called script language)

## History

Lisp is world first **High-Level** interpreter language.  
Steve Russell made at 1958 with **IBM 704** computer

## How Interpreter Working?

1. Interpreter interpret **Source Code** to **Middle code** line by line
2. Execute line by line


### Etc

Usually, **Compiled Program** is more faster than **Interpreted Program**

However interpreter adventage is no compile needed.

If project is big, compile time will be longer

But with interpreter, you don't need to wait

Interpreter give us fast(no compile time), comfortable(easy debugging) develop environment
